                    We offer to give a chance to a little and nice puppy
                    with an extremely wide and open heart. He or she will
                    love you more than anybody else in the world, you will
                    see!

                <h3>About the shelter “Cozy House”</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and statistics show that 
                    only 20% of them will find a family. The others will continue to live with us 
                    and will be waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly loved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do not get sick, 
                    feel comfortable (including psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87
                    volunteers and 28 employees of various skill levels. About 12% of the animals 
                    are taken by the shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached 
                    to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.
